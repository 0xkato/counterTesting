# counterTesting

To run this you will need to download foundry first. here is a link (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

after downloading foundry run foundryup
then check if you have forge and cast with running forge --version and cast --version
then run forge build
now you can run forge test to test your code

my first time testing with foundry
