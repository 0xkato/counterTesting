# counterTesting

To run this you will need to download foundry first. here is a link (https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

after downloading foundry run (foundryup)  </br>
then check if you have forge and cast by running <code>forge --version </code> and (cast --version) </br>
then run (forge build) </br>
now you can run (forge test) to test your code </br>
</br>
my first time testing with foundry </br>

I also recommend reading https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/forge-std?highlight=underflow#standard-libraries
