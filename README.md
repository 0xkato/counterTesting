# counterTesting

To run this you will need to download foundry first. here is a link to<a href="https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry"> foundry github repo</a>.

after downloading foundry run <code>foundryup</code>  </br>
then check if you have forge and cast by running <code>forge --version</code> and <code>cast --version</code> </br>
then run <code>forge build</code> </br>
now you can run <code>forge test</code> to test your code </br>
</br>
my first time testing with foundry </br>
